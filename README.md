# MNIST-classification
This project is made using the MNIST dataset and the models are trained to classify the handwritten digits.
1. We use logistic regression to classify the digits of the MNIST dataset
2. Then we also try to classify them using a normal feedforward neural network.
3. Lastly we use the convolutional neural networks to classify the digits of the MNIST dataset.

This practice helps us in understanding the boundaries of various model like with logistic regression you could only reach upto 50% accuracy whereas on the feeforward networks you can get upto 65% of accuracy.
And then when we use a convolutional neural network we can get to an accuracy of more than 90% which tells us why CNNs are better for Image Classification or Image related tasks
